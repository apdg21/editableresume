# Editable Resume Page

## Overview
This is a modern, editable resume webpage. The layout and content can be easily customized by editing the `data.json` file.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the resume.
- `style.css`: Styling to match a clean, modern design.
- `main.js`: JavaScript to load and display data from `data.json`.
- `data.json`: Contains all editable content (name, experience, skills, etc.).
- `assets/profile.jpg`: Placeholder for your profile photo (replace with your own image).

## Editing Instructions
1. **Update `data.json`**: Modify the JSON file with your personal information, skills, experience, education, languages, and contact details.
2. **Replace Profile Photo**: Update `assets/profile.jpg` with your own image.
3. **Customize Styles**: Edit `style.css` to adjust colors, fonts, or layout as needed.
4. **Test Locally**: Open `index.html` in a web browser to see the changes.

## Deployment
- Host the files on a web server or use a static site hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).
- Ensure the file paths (e.g., `assets/profile.jpg`, `style.css`, `main.js`) remain correct after deployment.

## Notes
- The design is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- Use a JSON validator to ensure `data.json` is correctly formatted before testing.
